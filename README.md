# JAVAFX_PROJECT

Bienvenue dans notre application de cinema / Welcome to our cinema Application

This text file is just to help you to configure the interface and have the best user experience as possible.

TO BEGIN :
    - Don't forget to add the lib to your project. All the necessary librairies are in the folder lib in the folder "JavaFXApplication". If you don't add them you will not be able to run our project. You will find this file at the same path to this "README.txt" :)
    - Add the DataBase to your wampserver or on mySql. If you don't do it you will not be able to see all the data. 
    - Do not forget to change the password the user and the url to the connection. You can change them in the file "Connecion.java" in the model package next to line 50.

THEN :
    When you are finished with that you can run the application and enjoy the hard work we have done during the last month.
